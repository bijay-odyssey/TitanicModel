# Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model built to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, utilizing the classic Titanic dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development to classify passenger survival.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912, resulting in the loss of over 1,500 lives. This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.
